imgur.js
===========

A Javascript client for the [Imgur API](http://api.imgur.com/).

You must [register](http://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient) your client with the Imgur API, and provide the Client-ID to
make *any* request to the API (see the [Authentication](https://api.imgur.com/#authentication) note). If you want to
perform actions on accounts, the user will have to authorize your application through [OAuth2](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2).
